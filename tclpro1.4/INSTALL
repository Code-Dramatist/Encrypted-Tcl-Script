0. Summary and Quick Start
==========================

On UNIX systems, run the "setup.sh" program on the CD-ROM.

On Windows, run the "setup.exe" program on the CD-ROM. This is launched
automatically if you allow autorun scripts.

Install TclPro 1.4 before uninstalling earlier versions so your
preference information can be carried forward to the new version.

You can leave earlier versions of TclPro installed.  The license and
preference information for different versions do not conflict.  You
should install different versions in different locations.

Multi-platform installs are supported so you can install TclPro on your
file server and share the installation on machines with different
architectures.  Only the UNIX installers offer multiple platforms to be
installed.  For this to work, all file server clients must access the
TclPro installation directory via the same pathname.  The executable
programs are segregated under directories named by the hardware
platform.

There are two kinds of license keys: named user and shared network.
Named user licenses are installed under the users home directory on
UNIX and in the registry on Windows. Use the "prolicense" program to
install license keys.

Shared network licenses work with the Ajuba Solutions License Server,
which must run on a UNIX machine accessible via TCP/IP.  It is best to
install the License Server from a root account so it can install boot
scripts that start the server when the machine boots up.  Otherwise you
have to install the boot scripts yourself.  For security reasons, the
License Server runs under a different user ID than root.  You do not
have to install TclPro on the machine running the License Server.

Use the License Server's Web interface to install shared network
licenses.  The Web interface also provides reports about TclPro usage
at your site.

If you use the License Server and you install TclPro on a file server,
you can record the location of the License Server as part of the TclPro
installation so users do not have to run prolicense.  To achieve this,
either run "prolicense -admin", or install TclPro under the Shared
Network License option from the first screen of the installer.  The
only difference between the two paths that install TclPro is how they
invoke the license manager at the end of the process.

Please read the rest of this README for more details about installation.

1. Introduction
===============

This file describes how to install TclPro on the following 
supported platforms:

  Operating System	Architecture	Version
  ----------------      ------------    -------
  Irix			SGI (Mips)	6.3+
  HP-UX			HP (PARISC)	10.20+
  Linux			Intel		Red Hat 5.0+ or SuSE 6.0+ *
  Solaris		Sun (Sparc)	2.5+
  Windows		Intel		95/98/NT 4.0+/2000

* Note -- Ajuba Solutions believes that TclPro will work with other 
  Linux distributions, such as Caldera Linux, that use glibc2. 
  However, Ajuba Solutions does not support these other Linux operating 
  systems at this time.

*** Important ***

  If at any time you need to move any of the files or folders
  containing files in the TclPro installation to a new location,
  you should uninstall and reinstall TclPro.

  After installing, consult the README file in the TclPro installation
  directory for more information about using TclPro.


2. Upgrading to the Latest TclPro Version
=========================================

If you are upgrading from a prior version of TclPro, we recommend that
you install and use the new version before uninstalling the prior
version.  After installing this release, please see the sections on
Licensing and Upgrading in the README file of your new installation
for information on how to gracefully uninstall prior versions of
TclPro.

If you are upgrading from an alpha or beta version of TclPro 1.4, we
recommend the following before installing this release: on Windows you
should uninstall the prior version before installing the final 1.4
release.  On Unix, you should remove the TclPro Debugger preference
files that match ~/.TclPro/1.4/* from your filesystem.

2b. Upgrading the License Server
================================

There is no need to upgrade the Ajuba Solutions License Server for
TclPro 1.4.  All you need to do is install the new Shared Network
License keys for TclPro 1.4.

However, if you previously installed the License Server from TclPro 1.3
and experienced troubles entering administrator passwords via the Web
interface, you can upgrade to fix that problem.  If you re-install the
1.4 License Server into the same location as the 1.3 (or 1.2) server then
it will automatically pick up your configuration information.  All your
existing licenses are preserved.

3. Installing TclPro on Windows
===============================

Note: If you are installing on a Windows NT system, you must be the
Administrator user, or a user with Administrator privileges, to
install TclPro.

Inserting the CD-ROM will automatically invoke the install program
setup.exe.  The installer will take you through the steps necessary to
install TclPro.  If you have disabled autoplay for CD-ROMs, you may
invoke the install program manually.  Select "Run" from the Windows
Start Menu, and enter the path to the setup program.  On a system
where D: is your CD-ROM drive, you will enter:

      D:\setup.exe

Please see the "Target Directory" and "TclPro Components" sections for
guidance in choosing which files to install and where to install them.
At the end of the installation, the installer will invoke the License
Manager to allow you to enter your Named User License key (or the
location of Ajuba Solutions License Server) that you are using.

Although Ajuba Solutions License Server must be installed on Unix, Windows
users can choose to use Shared Network Licenses.  All that is required
is a TCP/IP connection to a Unix machine on which the Ajuba Solutions
License Server is running.  Ajuba Solutions License Server can run on any of
our supported Unix platforms listed in the "Introduction" section.
You can run the TclPro License Manager (part of the TclPro
installation) to specify the location of the Ajuba Solutions License Server.

Your license key is printed on the CD-ROM case and on the packing list
included with your TclPro shipment.

If you need to change your TclPro license key (or the location of the
Ajuba Solutions License Server) at any time after installation, you can run
the License Manager program.  For example,

	prolicense

4. Installing TclPro or Ajuba Solutions License Server on UNIX
========================================================

Some UNIX systems restrict access to the CD-ROM drive to the root
user.  If you experience difficulties in accessing your TclPro CD-ROM,
consider retrying the installation process as the root user.  You must
also have permission to install to the directory that you select.  For
example, the default destination directory:

      /opt/ajuba/TclPro<version>

is normally restricted to the root user.  If you choose to install to
this path, you will need to do so from the root account.

4a. Mounting the CD-ROM
-----------------------

Insert the TclPro CD-ROM into your CD-ROM drive.  To access the CD-ROM
on HP-UX and Linux, you must mount the drive to a directory on your
filesystem.  Use the command in the table below to mount the CD-ROM.

Note: the HP-UX example in the table below assumes the CD-ROM device
is "/dev/dsk/c1t2d0".  Consult with your system administrator to learn
the name of your CD-ROM device.

	OS		Command to mount CD-ROM
	--		-----------------------
	HP-UX		mount -o cdcase /dev/dsk/c1t2d0 /cdrom
	Red Hat Linux	mount -o exec,mode=0555 /mnt/cdrom
	Suse Linux	mount -o exec,mode=0555 /mnt/cdrom
	Caldera Linux	mount -o exec,mode=0555 /dev/scd0 /mnt/cdrom

Use the command in the table below to run the TclPro installer.  To
run a text-only installation, just add the -T argument on the command
line.

	OS		Command to start installer
	--		--------------------------
	HP-UX		/cdrom/setup.sh
	Irix		/CDROM/setup.sh
	Red Hat Linux	/mnt/cdrom/setup.sh
	Suse Linux	/mnt/cdrom/setup.sh
	Caldera Linux	/mnt/cdrom/SETUP.SH or /mnt/cdrom/setup.sh
	Solaris		/cdrom/tclpro_1_3/setup.sh

Once you have started the installer program, see the "Choosing Unix
Licensing Options" section below for details about installation
options.

4b. Unmounting the CD-ROM
-------------------------

To unmount the CD-ROM, follow the directions in the table below.  Note
that you may need root access to invoke these commands.

	OS		Command to unmount CD-ROM
	--		-------------------------
	HP-UX		umount /cdrom
	Irix		eject cdrom
	Linux		umount /mnt/cdrom
	Solaris		eject cdrom


5. Choosing Unix Licensing Options
==================================

The installation program begins by asking you whether you are using a
Named User License or a Shared Network License.  Your choice depends
on which type of TclPro license you selected when you purchased
TclPro.  See the Licenses section in the README file for more details
about the new Shared Network License option.

5a. Installing TclPro for a Named User
--------------------------------------

This installation of TclPro is for you if either one of the following
applies to you:

    1) you are using a Named User License
    2) you have a TCP/IP connection to a machine running Ajuba Solutions
       License Server, but you can't access the site installation of
       TclPro from your machine.

Please see the "Target Directory", "Multiple Unix Platforms", and
"TclPro Components" sections for guidance in choosing which files to
install and where to install them.

At the end of the installation, the installer will invoke the License
Manager to allow you to enter your Named User License key (or the
location of Ajuba Solutions License Server) that you are using.

Your license key is printed on the CD-ROM case and on the packing list
included with your TclPro shipment.

If you need to change your TclPro license key (or the location of the
Ajuba Solutions License Server) at any time after installation, you can run
the License Manager program.  For example,

	prolicense

5b. Installing Ajuba Solutions License Server
---------------------------------------

Installation of Ajuba Solutions License Server is only necessary for people
using the Shared Network License.

Complete installation of Ajuba Solutions License Server requires that you
run the installer as root on one of the supported Unix platforms
(listed in the "Introduction" section).  For security purposes, you
will also be asked to enter a User ID and Group ID, so the server will
not actually run as root.  You will then need to specify a port for
communication between the server and TclPro tools.

Following the port, you will be asked to enter a destination directory
and a log directory.  Because log information can grow large over
time, many administrators like the log files to exist on separate
disks from an installation.  The installer will create the following
files:

	<destinationDir>/prolserver
	<destinationDir>/prolserver.conf
	<destinationDir>/prolserver.pid
	<destinationDir>/prolserver.state
	<destinationDir>/INSTALL.LOG
	<logDir>/prolserver.<port>.log

The "<destinationDir>/prolserver.conf" file contains information you
entered during the installation process as well as the license key you
will enter later via the Web interface to Ajuba Solutions License Server.

The "<logDir>/prolserver.<port>.log" file contains all information
regarding usage of TclPro tools.  The Web interface includes usage
reports that use the information in this log file.

After installation, you may choose to have the installer launch the
server program, "prolserver", for you.  Note that "prolserver" will
run as the userId you entered during installation, not as root.  Once
you have launched the server, you must enter user information and a
license key via your Web browser at:

	http://<hostname>:<port>

If you are running Ajuba Solutions License Server on the machine
"mars.mycompany.com" at the port 2577, your URL should look like the
following:

	http://mars.mycompany.com:2577

At this Web location, you can setup your server and then enter the
Shared Network License key.  The key is printed on the CD-ROM case and
on the packing list included with your TclPro shipment.  This Web
location has pointers to more documentation on this subject.

5c. Installing TclPro for Shared Network License Users
------------------------------------------------------

TclPro installation for Shared Network License Users is useful only
for people using Shared Network Licenses.  Please see the "Target
Directory", "Multiple Unix Platforms", and "TclPro Components"
sections for guidance in choosing which files to install and where to
install them.

At the end of the installation, the installer will ask you to enter
the location (host machine and port number) of your Ajuba Solutions License
Server.  If you need to change these values at any time after
installation, you can run the License Manager program with the -admin
flag.  For example,

	prolicense -admin

After setting the location of your Ajuba Solutions License Server, no
further setup is required. Tools in this TclPro installation will
automatically access Ajuba Solutions License Server running at the
location you specified.


6. Target Directory for TclPro Installation
===========================================

The installation program allows you to specify an absolute pathname to
the directory where TclPro will be installed.  TclPro creates several
files and directories in the target directory.  It is best to install
each TclPro version in its own directory, for example:

	Unix				Windows
	----				-------
        /opt/ajuba/TclPro1.3	C:\Program Files\TclPro1.3
        /opt/ajuba/TclPro1.4	C:\Program Files\TclPro1.4

You must also have permissions to install to the directory that you
select.  On Unix, the default destination directory
"/opt/ajuba/TclPro<version>" is normally restricted to the root
user.  If you choose to install to this path, you will need to do so
from the root account.  If you do not have root access to your
machine, ask your system administrator to help you with the
installation, or install the product into a directory where you have
write permission (e.g. your user account).


7. Multiple Unix Platforms
==========================

The Unix installation program allows you to install TclPro for
multiple Unix platforms in one target directory.  Note that each
machine using TclPro from the same directory must mount that directory
in the same manner. For example, if you install in
/opt/ajuba/TclPro on one machine, other machines must mount that
same directory (or have access to it) using the same path.


8. TclPro Components
====================

The installation program allows you to choose among the following
components:

	Basic
	C Development Libraries
	Tcl Sources
	Tk Sources
	[incr Tcl] Sources
	TclX Sources
	Expect Sources (Unix only)

Basic installation includes everything you need to run the TclPro
tools, including documentation, demos, libraries (for Tcl, Tk, and
incorporated extensions), and the tools themselves.

The "C Development Libraries" option is only necessary if you are
building a custom Tcl or Tk interpreter, or if you wish to use TclPro
Wrapper to wrap a custom application or an application that requires
any unsupported extensions.  The "C Development Libraries" component
offers libraries and header files needed to build a custom Tcl or Tk
interpreter.  See the README file for details about supported
extensions.

The remaining options include sources of Tcl, Tk, and incorporated
extensions that you may need to create custom Tcl interpreters.


9. Installing Adobe Acrobat Reader
==================================

The first decision screen of the TclPro installer offers the option to
install Adobe Acrobat Reader 3.0.  The TclPro User's Guide uses PDF
format, readable by Adobe Acrobat Reader 3.0+.  On Windows, this
option is selected by default if you don't already have a 3.0+
installation on your path.

10. Running TclPro Tools
========================

Please see the README file for details on how to set your PATH
environment variable and run the TclPro tools that you've just
installed.
