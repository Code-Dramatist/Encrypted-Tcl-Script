1. Introduction to TclPro 1.4
=============================

TclPro 1.4 is Ajuba Solutions' development environment for professional Tcl
developers.  TclPro 1.4 supports Tcl/Tk 8.3 (as well as some earlier
versions, as documented in "Supported Tcl/Tk Versions").  TclPro 1.4
includes TclPro Debugger, a powerful graphical debugger, TclPro
Checker, a Tcl static code checker, TclPro Compiler, a tool for
creating bytecode files from Tcl scripts, and TclPro Wrapper, a tool
for packaging collections of Tcl scripts and auxiliary files into a
single executable file for distribution.  TclPro 1.4 also includes the
complete extended Tcl development platform, with the popular Tcl
extensions [incr Tcl], TclX, and Expect (Unix only) updated for use
with Tcl/Tk 8.3.


2. Documentation
================

This release of TclPro includes the "TclPro User's Guide" in the PDF
format.  This file is located in the "doc" directory and named
"TclProUsersGuide.pdf".  Acrobat Reader 3.0 or later is required to
view or print these PDF files.  You can download a free copy of Acrobat
Reader from our Web site:

      http://www.ajubasolutions.com/support/acrobat.html

Windows Help
------------

Windows distributions of TclPro include Windows help files 
(located in doc\help).  The TclPro installer has added a TclPro 
entry in the "Programs" section of your "Start" menu.  The TclPro 
menu entry contains a shortcut to the Windows help files.

Unix HTML
---------

Unix distributions of TclPro include man pages for each TclPro 
component (located in doc/man) as well as Web-based documentation 
(located in doc/html).


3. Running TclPro Tools
=======================

The following executables are located in the "<platform>/bin"
directory, where <platform> is one of solaris-sparc, hpux-parisc,
irix-mips, linux-ix86, or win32-ix86.

    TclPro tool			Unix executables  Windows executables
    -----------			----------------  -------------------
    TclPro Checker		procheck	  procheck.exe
    TclPro Compiler		procomp		  procomp.exe
    TclPro Debugger		prodebug	  prodebug.exe
    TclPro Wrapper		prowrap		  prowrap.exe
    License Manager		prolicense	  prolicense.exe
       (text-based version)	prolicensetty
    Tcl Shell 8.3		protclsh83	  protclsh83.exe
    Wish 8.3			prowish83	  prowish83.exe
    Expect			expect		  (not supported)
    Expect and Tk		expectk		  (not supported)

3a. Running TclPro Tools on Windows
-----------------------------------

The TclPro installer adds a TclPro entry in the "Programs" section of
your "Start" menu.  The TclPro menu entry contains shortcuts to TclPro
Debugger, the License Manager, prowish, and protclsh.  TclPro Checker,
TclPro Compiler, and TclPro Wrapper are command-line applications, so
they cannot be run from the Start menu.  The TclPro installer adds
<installDir>/win32-ix86/bin to your PATH environment variable, so you
can run applications from the command-line by starting any available
shell (e.g., MS-DOS Command Prompt) and entering the appropriate
command.  The following is an example of how to use TclPro Checker to
check a file called "C:\myPrograms\foo.tcl":

	procheck C:\myPrograms\foo.tcl


3b. Running TclPro Tools in Unix
--------------------------------

All of the TclPro applications can be run from any shell (e.g., 
sh) by typing the full path and executable name on the command 
line (see section 3 above for the executable names).  To avoid 
typing the full path of each TclPro tool, we recommend that you 
add the TclPro bin directory to your PATH environment variable.  
The following is an example of how to do so in the "sh" shell:

	PATH="/opt/ajuba/TclPro<version>/<platform>/bin:$PATH"

TclPro Debugger and the License Manager program have a graphical user
interface.  TclPro Checker, TclPro Compiler, and TclPro Wrapper are
command-line applications.  Once you have modified your PATH variable,
you can use the following command to invoke TclPro Checker to check
all files matching the "~/myPrograms/*.tcl" glob pattern:

	procheck ~/myPrograms/*.tcl


4. Licensing
============

A Named User License for TclPro allows one named developer to use 
TclPro on any of the platforms we support; the license cannot be 
used by other developers, but it can be used by a single developer
on all the platforms they use.

When you download TclPro to evaluate it, an evaluation license key
with a 15-day limit is emailed to you.  When you purchase TclPro, a
permanent license key is emailed to you and shipped with your TclPro
CD-ROM distribution.  You may choose to enter the key during the
TclPro installation or enter the key later by using the License
Manager.  See the "Running TclPro Tools" section of the README file
for details on running the License Manager.  Visit our Web site for
more information on licensing:

	http://www.ajubasolutions.com/tclpro/aboutLicenses.html

TclPro 1.3 or earlier license keys will not work with the 1.4 release.
However, you can safely install the 1.4 15-day evaluation license key
without losing your existing key and the ability to use an earlier
version of TclPro.

With a Named User License, each TclPro developer must obtain and 
enter a license key.  A Named User License is valid on all 
supported platforms used by a particular developer.  For example, 
if a single developer uses several platforms, he or she is 
permitted to use a single Named User License on all platforms he 
or she uses. Of course, more than one developer cannot share the 
same license.

TclPro tools will not work unless a valid license key has been 
entered, and the evaluation license key is only valid for 15 days 
from the day you registered for the evaluation.  If you are 
planning on purchasing TclPro, please do so before the 15 days are 
up and you can upgrade your 15-day license to a permanent one.


5. C/C++ Development on Windows
===========================

If you are using the Web download of TclPro on Windows, and you 
wish to do C/C++ program development, you will need the
tclprodev<version>.zip file.  This file can be downloaded from
the same location where you downloaded the rest of TclPro.

The tclprodev<version>.zip file is an optional component which 
contains the libraries and header files necessary for C program 
development.  You can extract this zip file into the installation
directory of TclPro.

6. Supported Operating Systems and Tcl/Tk Versions
==================================================

TclPro 1.4 is supported on the following operating systems:

  Operating System	Architecture	Version
  ----------------      ------------    -------
  Irix			SGI (Mips)	6.3+
  HP-UX			HP (PARISC)	10.20+
  Linux			Intel		Red Hat 5.0+ or SuSE 6.0+ *
  Solaris		Sun (Sparc)	2.5+
  Windows		Intel		95/98/NT 4.0/2000

* Note -- Ajuba believes that TclPro will work with other 
  Linux distributions, such as Caldera Linux, that use glibc2. 
  However, Ajuba does not support these other Linux operating 
  systems at this time.

TclPro 1.4 is designed primarily for Tcl/Tk version 8.3.  Some of the
TclPro tools support earlier Tcl/Tk versions as well, as described in
this section.

TclPro Debugger
---------------

Under Unix, TclPro Debugger can also be used with Tcl 7.6 and Tk 4.2 and later 
versions.  However, Ajuba's support for Tcl 7.6 and Tk 4.2 covers only 
problems in TclPro Debugger and not problems in Tcl 7.6 or Tk 4.2.

In many cases TclPro Debugger can also be used under Unix with Tcl 7.5
and Tk 4.1;  it can also be used in some cases under NT with Tcl 7.6
and Tk 4.2.  However, there are known bugs in the socket implementation
under these older versions of Tcl (fixed in later versions) that may affect
the operation of TclPro Debugger, so Ajuba does not support these
older versions.

TclPro Debugger supports custom Tcl interpreters as long as they are
based on supported Tcl/Tk versions and no standard Tcl commands are
radically redefined.  An example of radical redefinition of the "proc"
command would be to redefine it to take four arguments instead of
three.  In particular, avoid altering the following Tcl commands:

	array break catch cd close concat continue eof error eval
	exit expr fconfigure file fileevent flush for foreach gets
	global if incr info lappend lindex linsert list llength
	lrange lreplace lsearch namespace open proc puts pwd read
	regexp regsub rename return set string switch trace unset
	uplevel upvar variable vwait while

Using the remote debugging facility, it is possible to use TclPro
Debugger to test applications running on platforms other than those
listed above.  TclPro Debugger must run on a supported platform, but
it can communicate with, and debug, applications running on
unsupported platforms.  However, Ajuba cannot provide help in
fixing problems related to unsupported platforms.

TclPro Checker
--------------

TclPro Checker may be used on older releases of Tcl and Tk back through
Tcl 7.3 and Tk 3.6.

TclPro Compiler
---------------

TclPro Compiler now generates bytecode files in version 1.3 format
(to support Tcl 8.1 and later).  These new bytecode files require version
1.3 of the tbcload package.  TclPro Compiler can also compile
Tcl 8.0 scripts (the output is still a version 1.3 bytecode file).

The new 1.3 version of the bytecode file interpreter package supports
the following bytecode file formats:

 * 1.3   (generated by TclPro Compiler 1.3 and 1.4)
 * 1.0.1 (generated by TclPro Compiler 1.2)

The tbcload 1.3 package does *not* support version 1.0 bytecode files
(generated by TclPro Compiler 1.0).
